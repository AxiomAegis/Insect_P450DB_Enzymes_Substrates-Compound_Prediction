abstract = {ABSTRACT Insects, the most numerous and diverse group of animal species on Earth, have important interactions with humans through providing resources, transmitting diseases and damaging agricultural cultivars. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are one of the most important protein families in insects implicated in the endogenous metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics, including allelochemicals, insecticides and environmental pollutants. To better understand the evolution and function of insect P450s and support the development and application of insecticides for pest control, an integrated bioinformatics platform is highly desirable. Here, we present the Insect Cytochrome P450 database (ICPD, http://www.insectp450.net/), which contains 66,477 P450s collected from public databases and predicted from the genomes of 682 insect species using a standardised bioinformatics protocol. Phylogenetic relationships between P450 genes are constructed for each species. The structures of all P450 proteins in the database are predicted using ESMFold, then visualised using WeView. Web services, such as BLAST, homogeneous modelling and molecular docking, are provided for determining the catalytic activities of P450 proteins. The ICPD will facilitate systematic investigations of the evolution and functions of the complete insect P450 complement, and represents a powerful tool for guiding insecticide design and application.},
